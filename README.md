A simple GWT library for interacting with Google Analytics

Quick Start
===========

The simplest way to use the library is to add the gwt-ga dependencies into the build
system. i.e.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.realityforge.gwt.ga</groupId>
   <artifactId>gwt-ga</artifactId>
   <version>0.4</version>
   <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Credit
======

Note: All credit goes to the initial authors from the GWTP project. This version was
extracted from that project some time ago and has migrated from project to project before
landing in this repository.
